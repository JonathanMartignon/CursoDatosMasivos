defined as [[self-governance|self-governed]], voluntary institutions,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man\\&#39;s natural social tendencies.&amp;quot; George Woodcock. &amp;quot;Anarchism&amp;quot; at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions.&amp;quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. &amp;quot;Anarchism&amp;quot; from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Anarchism.&amp;quot; The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 &amp;quot;Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.&amp;quot; Judith Suissa. \\&#39;\\&#39;Anarchism and Education: a Philosophical Perspective\\&#39;\\&#39;.

There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a &amp;quot;classless&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;libertarian&amp;quot; society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.&amp;quot; [[Murray Bookchin]]. \\&#39;\\&#39;The Ecology of Freedom: the emergence and dissolution of Hierarchy.

Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those &amp;quot;authoritative&amp;quot; powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation.&amp;quot;[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false \\&#39;\\&#39;Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism\\&#39;\\&#39; by Paul McLaughlin.

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism&amp;amp;nbsp;... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.  representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.&amp;quot; [[Benjamin Tucker]].

Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers\\&#39; leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]\\&#39;s \\&#39;\\&#39;[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]\\&#39;\\&#39;.&amp;quot; Marlow. &amp;quot;Anarchism and Christianity&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Although Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609 – c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving.
