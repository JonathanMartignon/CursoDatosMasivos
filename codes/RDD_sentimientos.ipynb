This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>30-Jul-18</td><td>Charcoal Fabric </td><td>Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it.

Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll.

You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries.

My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.

I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>11-Jun-18</td><td>Black</td><td>I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs.

No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box!

Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.

My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.

I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>11-Jun-18</td><td>Black</td><td>I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs.

I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome.

Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.

My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs&#39;,\n &#39;Music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Without having a cellphone&#39;,\n &#34;I think this is the 5th one I&#39;ve purchased. I&#39;m working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.&#34;,\n &#39;looks great&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I sent it to my 85 year old Dad&#39;,\n &#34;I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it&#39;s been easy to use and understand.

Great speaker and easy to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.&#39;,\n &#39;We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top&#39;,\n &#39;Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;We love Alexa! We use her to play music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size&#39;,\n &#39;I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I got a second unit for the bedroom&#39;,\n &#39;Amazing product&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love my Echo. It\\&#39;s easy to operate&#39;,\n &#39;Sounds great!! Love them!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask&#39;,\n &#39;Just like the other one&#39;,\n &#39;Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good&#39;,\n &#39;I like it&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique&#39;,\n &#34;The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I&#39;ve done it correctly but they won&#39;t sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.&#34;,\n &#39;This device is awesome!&#39;,\n &#39;I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package&#39;,\n &#39;Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;This is my first digital assistant so I\\&#39;m giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That\\&#39;s what I was going to get in the first place&#39;,\n &#34;My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it&#39;s capabilities&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately&#39;,\n &#39;So far so good&#39;,\n &#39;Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.&#39;,\n &#39;Great&#39;,\n &#39;Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;It\\&#39;s like Siri&#39;,\n &#39;Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.&#39;,\n &#39;I love you so much&#39;,\n &#39;No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Excelente&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I\\&#39;m still learning how to use it&#39;,\n &#39;Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.&#39;,\n &#39;The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.&#39;,\n &#39;like google better&#39;,\n &#39;Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.&#39;,\n &#39;Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.&#39;,\n &#39;Great sound and easy to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love Alexa&#39;,\n &#39;Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs&#39;,\n &#39;😍&#39;,\n &#39;Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things&#39;,\n &#39;Love this just wish it had a built in hub&#39;,\n &#39;I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!&#39;,\n &#39;How easy if was to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.&#39;,\n &#39;You’re all I need...na na nana!&#39;,\n &#39;Does everything as expected and more.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don\\&#39;t have a &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; home&#39;,\n &#39;Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.&#39;,\n &#39;Works and sounds great.&#39;,\n &#39;The sound is amazing and many collections of all music&#39;,\n &#39;Setting up&#39;,\n &#39;She doesn’t always listen&#39;,\n &#39;It’s awesome&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting&#39;,\n &#39;The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!&#39;,\n &#39;I LIKE IT ALL&#39;,\n &#39;I love it. It does everything&#39;,\n &#34;I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I&#39;m not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn&#39;t take me to long to figure it out!! I&#39;m very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!&#34;,\n &#39;I like it and still learning how to use it.&#39;,\n &#34;Great technology!! Can&#39;t believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation)&#39;,\n &#39;Works fine!!&#39;,\n &#39; &#39;,\n &#39;Clear music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Fun to use&#39;,\n &#39;The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Works great&#39;,\n &#39;Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!&#39;,\n &#39;The speaker sounds really good&#39;,\n &#39;Good sound works well&#39;,\n &#39;Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;We like it all so far&#39;,\n &#34;Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it&#39;s great!&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;Love the Echo !!! I love the size&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!&#39;,\n &#39;The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;awesome thing&#39;,\n &#39;It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;LOVE&#39;,\n &#39;The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.&#39;,\n &#39;Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!&#39;,\n &#34;I&#39;m really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it&#39;s coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that &#39;,\n &#39;The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Great device&#39;,\n &#39;Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn\\&#39;t work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&amp;#34; .don\\&#39;t have or don&amp;#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.&#39;,\n &#39;Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Works great&#39;,\n &#34;It&#39;s Alexa.... what else can you say&#34;,\n &#39;Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Excellent product&#39;,\n &#34;I&#39;ve had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I&#39;m happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.&#34;,\n &#39;I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.&#39;,\n &#39;wonderful product and fast delivery!&#39;,\n &#39;Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.&#39;,\n &#39;It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!&#39;,\n &#39;Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.&#39;,\n &#39;How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .&#39;,\n &#39;Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.&#39;,\n &#39;Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I\\&#39;ve only used it to listen to music and check the weather&#39;,\n &#39;Love our echo&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love it&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;It\\&#39;s better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &amp;#34;-&amp;#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all&#39;,\n &#39;I love having an Alexa!&#39;,\n &#39;So far I like it 🤓&#39;,\n &#39;I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.&#39;,\n &#39;Still love it&#39;,\n &#39;Love it&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love the sound quality of this unit&#39;,\n &#39;I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I have had for only a week&#39;,\n &#39;Not much features.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Great sound quality&#39;,\n &#39;Cool&#39;,\n &#39;Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.&#39;,\n &#34;it&#39;s annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself&#34;,\n &#34;I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn&#39;t be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear&#39;,\n &#39;I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.&#39;,\n &#34;The Echo is wonderful but I&#39;m still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;Doesn\\&#39;t know half the things asked. Can\\&#39;t recognize my sprinkler wifi controller&#39;,\n &#39;Love it&#39;,\n &#39;awesome.understands my kids&#39;,\n &#39;We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.&#39;,\n &#39;Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video&#39;,\n &#39;This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn\\&#39;t resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn\\&#39;t be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my &#34;&#34;smart&#34;&#34; devices. Thanks to her&#39;,\n &#39;Versatile and fun !!!&#39;,\n &#39;Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.&#39;,\n &#39;We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Stopped working after 2 weeks &#39;,\n &#39;so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;It performs pretty much as expected&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected&#39;,\n &#39;A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.&#39;,\n &#39;Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love it&#39;,\n &#39;Good Value&#39;,\n &#39;Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!&#39;,\n &#39;Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa&#39;,\n &#34;BEST father&#39;s day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.&#34;,\n &#39;Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.&#39;,\n &#39;Sound quality&#39;,\n &#39;Sad joke. Worthless.&#39;,\n &#39;Entertainment&#39;,\n &#39;Very good quality&#39;,\n &#39;Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability&#39;,\n &#34;Loved it till someone stoled it. Can&#39;t afford to replace it yet but I am going too.&#34;,\n &#39;Alexa rocks&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself&#39;,\n &#39; &#39;,\n &#39;&#34;My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!! Great product!!!&#39;,\n &#39;Easy set up very user friendly&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this&#39;,\n &#34;I don&#39;t think the &amp;#34;2nd gen&amp;#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn&#39;t you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn&#39;t unique to this unit but I don&#39;t understand why I can&#39;t override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &amp;#34;group&amp;#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.&#34;,\n &#39;Everything&#39;,\n &#39;I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.&#39;,\n &#39;Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.&#39;,\n &#39;I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!  So do the grandkids!!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices&#39;,\n &#39;Works as advertised&#39;,\n &#39;I love it!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Like everything about it. The music&#39;,\n &#39;As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.&#39;,\n &#39;A great device&#39;,\n &#39;I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..&#39;,\n &#39;Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!&#39;,\n &#34;Very nice!  I&#39;m impressed - wish she had more to say though.&#34;,\n &#39;Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!&#39;,\n &#34;It&#39;s got great sound and bass but it doesn&#39;t work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things&#34;,\n &#39;We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.&#39;,\n &#39;Amazing paroduct&#39;,\n &#34;Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn&#39;t quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.&#34;,\n &#39;speaker sounds good&#39;,\n &#39;Absolutely love!!&#39;,\n &#39;The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.&#39;,\n &#34;We&#39;re thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We&#39;re enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We&#39;ve added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We&#39;re looking forward to adding more automation to our home.&#34;,\n &#39;Home entertainment&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Very cool product. Easy to setup&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love these&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Doesn\\&#39;t work with my fairly new smart TV&#39;,\n &#39;Great sound from a little speaker&#39;,\n &#39;We enjoy it&#39;,\n &#39; &#39;,\n &#39;Cool&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Good quality&#39;,\n &#39;Works perfectly&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all&#39;,\n &#39;Love my Echo great sound very smart!&#39;,\n &#39;Sure did !! Love it !!&#39;,\n &#39;plays great&#39;,\n &#39;Works absolutely great&#39;,\n &#39;Very amazing product. Great sound quality.&#39;,\n &#34;Best thing I&#39;ve invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &amp;#34;warehouse&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;outlet&amp;#34; with a &amp;#34;minor imperfection. Can\\&#39;t tell it even has one. works great. Didn\\&#39;t come in packaging&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it\\&#39;s wonderful!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Awesome life changer! Seriously&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed&#39;,\n &#39;I like everything about it !!!&#39;,\n &#39;Liked 100%&#39;,\n &#39;Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.&#39;,\n &#39;Our family really loves this new Echo&#39;,\n &#39;bought for my wife she loves it&#39;,\n &#39;Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.&#39;,\n &#39;Like it to do more&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It\\&#39;s like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom&#39;,\n &#39;Listen music and set timer&#39;,\n &#39;I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!&#39;,\n &#39;Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!&#39;,\n &#39;Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;This echo is just as great as my others&#39;,\n &#39;Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I bought this to replace a &amp;#34;Dot&amp;#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I have had all good experience&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it&#39;,\n &#34;Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I&#39;m too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.&#34;,\n &#39;Enjoyed entire echo experience&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward&#39;,\n &#39;We are loving Ours very much&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I\\&#39;m happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.\\&#39;s&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.&#39;,\n &#39;Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did&#39;,\n &#39;Arrived as expected.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don\\&#39;t forget to buy a charger when ordering&#39;,\n &#39;Terrific&#39;,\n &#39;Love my Echo&#39;,\n &#39;It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.&#39;,\n &#39;Works great!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;My husband and I are what I would call &amp;#34;late adopters&amp;#34; when it come to technology&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels&#39;,\n &#39;I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.&#39;,\n &#39;We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.&#39;,\n &#39;See subject line.  Love it&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!&#39;,\n &#39;Very easy setup.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality&#39;,\n &#39;Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!&#39;,\n &#39;Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.&#39;,\n &#39;I love it!!&#39;,\n &#39;Works great! Perfect for my office!&#39;,\n &#39;Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -&#39;,\n &#39;easy to use--amazing&#39;,\n &#39;Nice product A+&#39;,\n &#39;We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!&#39;,\n &#39;Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.&#39;,\n &#34;It&#39;s so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has&#39;,\n &#39;Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!&#39;,\n &#39;Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I replaced my 1st gen&#39;,\n &#39;Great addition to my Echo Plus!&#39;,\n &#39;the best&#39;,\n &#39;Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.&#39;,\n &#39;I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.&#39;,\n &#39;I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.&#39;,\n &#39;Very easy to set up and have no issues.&#39;,\n &#39;This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)&#39;,\n &#34;It&#39;s extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn&#39;t answer everything I ask but it&#39;s still nice to use.&#34;,\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 31316 bytes of output ***\n\n &#34;I think this is the 5th one I&#39;ve purchased. I&#39;m working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.&#34;,\n &#39;looks great&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I sent it to my 85 year old Dad&#39;,\n &#34;I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it&#39;s been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love&#39;,\n &#39;Just what I expected....&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love it&#39;,\n &#39;Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.&#39;,\n &#39;We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top&#39;,\n &#39;Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;We love Alexa! We use her to play music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size&#39;,\n &#39;I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I got a second unit for the bedroom&#39;,\n &#39;Amazing product&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love my Echo. It\\&#39;s easy to operate&#39;,\n &#39;Sounds great!! Love them!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask&#39;,\n &#39;Just like the other one&#39;,\n &#39;Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good&#39;,\n &#39;I like it&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique&#39;,\n &#34;The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I&#39;ve done it correctly but they won&#39;t sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.&#34;,\n &#39;This device is awesome!&#39;,\n &#39;I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package&#39;,\n &#39;Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;This is my first digital assistant so I\\&#39;m giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That\\&#39;s what I was going to get in the first place&#39;,\n &#34;My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it&#39;s capabilities&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately&#39;,\n &#39;So far so good&#39;,\n &#39;Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.&#39;,\n &#39;Great&#39;,\n &#39;Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;It\\&#39;s like Siri&#39;,\n &#39;Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.&#39;,\n &#39;I love you so much&#39;,\n &#39;No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Excelente&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I\\&#39;m still learning how to use it&#39;,\n &#39;Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.&#39;,\n &#39;The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.&#39;,\n &#39;like google better&#39;,\n &#39;Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.&#39;,\n &#39;Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.&#39;,\n &#39;Great sound and easy to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love Alexa&#39;,\n &#39;Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs&#39;,\n &#39;😍&#39;,\n &#39;Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things&#39;,\n &#39;Love this just wish it had a built in hub&#39;,\n &#39;I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!&#39;,\n &#39;How easy if was to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.&#39;,\n &#39;You’re all I need...na na nana!&#39;,\n &#39;Does everything as expected and more.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don\\&#39;t have a &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; home&#39;,\n &#39;Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.&#39;,\n &#39;Works and sounds great.&#39;,\n &#39;The sound is amazing and many collections of all music&#39;,\n &#39;Setting up&#39;,\n &#39;She doesn’t always listen&#39;,\n &#39;It’s awesome&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting&#39;,\n &#39;The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!&#39;,\n &#39;I LIKE IT ALL&#39;,\n &#39;I love it. It does everything&#39;,\n &#34;I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I&#39;m not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn&#39;t take me to long to figure it out!! I&#39;m very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!&#34;,\n &#39;I like it and still learning how to use it.&#39;,\n &#34;Great technology!! Can&#39;t believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation)&#39;,\n &#39;Works fine!!&#39;,\n &#39; &#39;,\n &#39;Clear music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Fun to use&#39;,\n &#39;The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Works great&#39;,\n &#39;Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!&#39;,\n &#39;The speaker sounds really good&#39;,\n &#39;Good sound works well&#39;,\n &#39;Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;We like it all so far&#39;,\n &#34;Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it&#39;s great!&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;Love the Echo !!! I love the size&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!&#39;,\n &#39;The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;awesome thing&#39;,\n &#39;It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;LOVE&#39;,\n &#39;The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.&#39;,\n &#39;Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!&#39;,\n &#34;I&#39;m really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it&#39;s coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that &#39;,\n &#39;The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Great device&#39;,\n &#39;Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn\\&#39;t work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&amp;#34; .don\\&#39;t have or don&amp;#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.&#39;,\n &#39;Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Works great&#39;,\n &#34;It&#39;s Alexa.... what else can you say&#34;,\n &#39;Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Excellent product&#39;,\n &#34;I&#39;ve had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I&#39;m happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.&#34;,\n &#39;I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.&#39;,\n &#39;wonderful product and fast delivery!&#39;,\n &#39;Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.&#39;,\n &#39;It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!&#39;,\n &#39;Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.&#39;,\n &#39;How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .&#39;,\n &#39;Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.&#39;,\n &#39;Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I\\&#39;ve only used it to listen to music and check the weather&#39;,\n &#39;Love our echo&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love it&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;It\\&#39;s better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &amp;#34;-&amp;#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all&#39;,\n &#39;I love having an Alexa!&#39;,\n &#39;So far I like it 🤓&#39;,\n &#39;I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.&#39;,\n &#39;Still love it&#39;,\n &#39;Love it&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love the sound quality of this unit&#39;,\n &#39;I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I have had for only a week&#39;,\n &#39;Not much features.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Great sound quality&#39;,\n &#39;Cool&#39;,\n &#39;Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.&#39;,\n &#34;it&#39;s annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself&#34;,\n &#34;I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn&#39;t be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear&#39;,\n &#39;I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.&#39;,\n &#34;The Echo is wonderful but I&#39;m still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;Doesn\\&#39;t know half the things asked. Can\\&#39;t recognize my sprinkler wifi controller&#39;,\n &#39;Love it&#39;,\n &#39;awesome.understands my kids&#39;,\n &#39;We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.&#39;,\n &#39;Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video&#39;,\n &#39;This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn\\&#39;t resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn\\&#39;t be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my &#34;&#34;smart&#34;&#34; devices. Thanks to her&#39;,\n &#39;Versatile and fun !!!&#39;,\n &#39;Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.&#39;,\n &#39;We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Stopped working after 2 weeks &#39;,\n &#39;so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;It performs pretty much as expected&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected&#39;,\n &#39;A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.&#39;,\n &#39;Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love it&#39;,\n &#39;Good Value&#39;,\n &#39;Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!&#39;,\n &#39;Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa&#39;,\n &#34;BEST father&#39;s day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.&#34;,\n &#39;Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.&#39;,\n &#39;Sound quality&#39;,\n &#39;Sad joke. Worthless.&#39;,\n &#39;Entertainment&#39;,\n &#39;Very good quality&#39;,\n &#39;Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability&#39;,\n &#34;Loved it till someone stoled it. Can&#39;t afford to replace it yet but I am going too.&#34;,\n &#39;Alexa rocks&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself&#39;,\n &#39; &#39;,\n &#39;&#34;My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!! Great product!!!&#39;,\n &#39;Easy set up very user friendly&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this&#39;,\n &#34;I don&#39;t think the &amp;#34;2nd gen&amp;#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn&#39;t you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn&#39;t unique to this unit but I don&#39;t understand why I can&#39;t override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &amp;#34;group&amp;#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.&#34;,\n &#39;Everything&#39;,\n &#39;I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.&#39;,\n &#39;Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.&#39;,\n &#39;I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!  So do the grandkids!!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices&#39;,\n &#39;Works as advertised&#39;,\n &#39;I love it!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Like everything about it. The music&#39;,\n &#39;As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.&#39;,\n &#39;A great device&#39;,\n &#39;I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..&#39;,\n &#39;Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!&#39;,\n &#34;Very nice!  I&#39;m impressed - wish she had more to say though.&#34;,\n &#39;Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!&#39;,\n &#34;It&#39;s got great sound and bass but it doesn&#39;t work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things&#34;,\n &#39;We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.&#39;,\n &#39;Amazing paroduct&#39;,\n &#34;Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn&#39;t quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.&#34;,\n &#39;speaker sounds good&#39;,\n &#39;Absolutely love!!&#39;,\n &#39;The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.&#39;,\n &#34;We&#39;re thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We&#39;re enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We&#39;ve added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We&#39;re looking forward to adding more automation to our home.&#34;,\n &#39;Home entertainment&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Very cool product. Easy to setup&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Love these&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Doesn\\&#39;t work with my fairly new smart TV&#39;,\n &#39;Great sound from a little speaker&#39;,\n &#39;We enjoy it&#39;,\n &#39; &#39;,\n &#39;Cool&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Good quality&#39;,\n &#39;Works perfectly&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all&#39;,\n &#39;Love my Echo great sound very smart!&#39;,\n &#39;Sure did !! Love it !!&#39;,\n &#39;plays great&#39;,\n &#39;Works absolutely great&#39;,\n &#39;Very amazing product. Great sound quality.&#39;,\n &#34;Best thing I&#39;ve invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &amp;#34;warehouse&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;outlet&amp;#34; with a &amp;#34;minor imperfection. Can\\&#39;t tell it even has one. works great. Didn\\&#39;t come in packaging&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it\\&#39;s wonderful!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Awesome life changer! Seriously&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed&#39;,\n &#39;I like everything about it !!!&#39;,\n &#39;Liked 100%&#39;,\n &#39;Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.&#39;,\n &#39;Our family really loves this new Echo&#39;,\n &#39;bought for my wife she loves it&#39;,\n &#39;Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.&#39;,\n &#39;Like it to do more&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It\\&#39;s like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom&#39;,\n &#39;Listen music and set timer&#39;,\n &#39;I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!&#39;,\n &#39;Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!&#39;,\n &#39;Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;This echo is just as great as my others&#39;,\n &#39;Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I bought this to replace a &amp;#34;Dot&amp;#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I have had all good experience&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it&#39;,\n &#34;Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I&#39;m too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.&#34;,\n &#39;Enjoyed entire echo experience&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to set up.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward&#39;,\n &#39;We are loving Ours very much&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I\\&#39;m happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.\\&#39;s&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.&#39;,\n &#39;Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did&#39;,\n &#39;Arrived as expected.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don\\&#39;t forget to buy a charger when ordering&#39;,\n &#39;Terrific&#39;,\n &#39;Love my Echo&#39;,\n &#39;It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.&#39;,\n &#39;Works great!&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;My husband and I are what I would call &amp;#34;late adopters&amp;#34; when it come to technology&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels&#39;,\n &#39;I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.&#39;,\n &#39;We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.&#39;,\n &#39;See subject line.  Love it&#39;,\n &#39;Love it!&#39;,\n &#39;Very easy setup.&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality&#39;,\n &#39;Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!&#39;,\n &#39;Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.&#39;,\n &#39;I love it!!&#39;,\n &#39;Works great! Perfect for my office!&#39;,\n &#39;Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -&#39;,\n &#39;easy to use--amazing&#39;,\n &#39;Nice product A+&#39;,\n &#39;We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!&#39;,\n &#39;Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.&#39;,\n &#34;It&#39;s so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...&#34;,\n &#39;&#34;I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has&#39;,\n &#39;Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!&#39;,\n &#39;Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I replaced my 1st gen&#39;,\n &#39;Great addition to my Echo Plus!&#39;,\n &#39;the best&#39;,\n &#39;Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.&#39;,\n &#39;I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.&#39;,\n &#39;I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it&#39;,\n &#39;Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.&#39;,\n &#39;Very easy to set up and have no issues.&#39;,\n &#39;This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)&#39;,\n &#34;It&#39;s extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn&#39;t answer everything I ask but it&#39;s still nice to use.&#34;,\n &#39;Too difficult to set up.

we are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.&#39;, &#39;we love the size of the 2nd generation echo. still needs a little improvement on sound&#39;, &#39;&#34;i liked the original echo. this is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. i miss the volume ring on top&#39;, &#39;love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify. she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs.&#39;, &#39;&#34;we love alexa!

i&#39;m very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!&#34;, &#39;i like it and still learning how to use it.&#39;, &#34;great technology!! can&#39;t believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. wish i had bought another one!&#34;, &#39;&#34;i purchased an echo dot for my husband for fathers day.  he uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the echo (2nd generation)&#39;, &#39;works fine!!&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;clear music&#39;, &#39;&#34;fun to use&#39;, &#39;the echo works well. i was able to sync it with my other amazon music devices.&#39;, &#39;&#34;works great&#39;, &#39;already had an echo dot. the echo is even better with fuller sound. also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!&#39;, &#39;the speaker sounds really good&#39;, &#39;good sound works well&#39;, &#39;love it and alexa. i am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.&#39;, &#39;&#34;love it!

(5 and 7 yrs).  very cute.&#39;, &#39;&#34;4.5 out of 5 stars. i generally like this product. its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music&#39;, &#39;&#34;works great&#39;, &#34;it&#39;s alexa.... what else can you say&#34;, &#39;upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. happy with sound&#39;, &#39;&#34;excellent product&#39;, &#34;i&#39;ve had the first gen echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. i purchased the 2nd gen during prime day and so far i&#39;m happy. it seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.&#34;, &#39;i love my echo smart speaker.  i love the volume and clarity.  it was easy to set up.  its a wonderful gift for any age.&#39;, &#39;wonderful product and fast delivery!&#39;, &#39;initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.&#39;, &#39;it was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!&#39;, &#39;has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.&#39;, &#39;how did i live this long without the echo . you get to enjoy any music style  just my asking alexa . going to up-greade to the wireless . love the echo . love you too alexa .&#39;, &#39;very cool product. speaker sounds good with my spotify blasting through it.&#39;, &#39;having so much fun with alexa. love being able to listen to music when i’m across the room or busy doing something else.&#39;, &#39;&#34;so far it seems to be a very nice item. it picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. the other day i asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. i\\&#39;ve only used it to listen to music and check the weather&#39;, &#39;love our echo&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love it&#39;, &#39;&#34;it\\&#39;s better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  i really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  it was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &amp;#34;-&amp;#34; one and press it a few times.  i also wish the bass was a bit better.  all in all&#39;, &#39;i love having an alexa!&#39;, &#39;so far i like it 🤓&#39;, &#39;i am thoroughly enjoying my ecoo!  love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then i can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.&#39;, &#39;still love it&#39;, &#39;love it&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love the sound quality of this unit&#39;, &#39;i just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. the system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming sirius.&#39;, &#39;&#34;i have had for only a week&#39;, &#39;not much features.&#39;, &#39;&#34;great sound quality&#39;, &#39;cool&#39;, &#39;everyone should have an echo or two or three or more. i bought my echo through qvc.&#39;, &#34;it&#39;s annoying that everything they show alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. you spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself&#34;, &#34;i have had alexa since the beginning.  i accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  i decided i couldn&#39;t be without an echo.  setup was easy and had it working within minutes.&#34;, &#39;&#34;i like being able to tell alexia the music i want to hear&#39;, &#39;i like the looks better than the original echo.  i moved my old echo to the basement family room. nice sound.&#39;, &#34;the echo is wonderful but i&#39;m still learning how to use it. music requests are somewhat limited.&#34;, &#39;&#34;doesn\\&#39;t know half the things asked. can\\&#39;t recognize my sprinkler wifi controller&#39;, &#39;love it&#39;, &#39;awesome.understands my kids&#39;, &#39;we were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. how nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. looking forward to exploring other options with this device.&#39;, &#39;met and exceeded my expectations. easy set up and is really quick in responses.&#39;, &#39;&#34;i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa. i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc. to the commands from alexa. but&#39;, &#39;&#34;i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  i think it should be part of the top line with video&#39;, &#39;this is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. thank you!&#39;, &#39;&#34;during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i couldn\\&#39;t resist! this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i couldn\\&#39;t be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my &#34;&#34;smart&#34;&#34; devices. thanks to her&#39;, &#39;versatile and fun !!!&#39;, &#39;works great! killer speaker! my wife and son love it.&#39;, &#39;we regret waiting so long to purchase this item. we are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.&#39;, &#39;&#34;stopped working after 2 weeks &#39;, &#39;so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app&#39;, &#39;&#34;it performs pretty much as expected&#39;, &#39;easy to set up.&#39;, &#39;i like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality i expected&#39;, &#39;a great investment. alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.&#39;, &#39;yet another exho for our home and love them all!!!&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love it&#39;, &#39;good value&#39;, &#39;super easy set up and am loving our new echo!&#39;, &#39;whats not to like about this speaker.  just ask alexa&#39;, &#34;best father&#39;s day gift. dad joked to my mom that alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.&#34;, &#39;great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  tunes and information instantly available.  slowly learning more features.&#39;, &#39;sound quality&#39;, &#39;sad joke. worthless.&#39;, &#39;entertainment&#39;, &#39;very good quality&#39;, &#39;works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability&#39;, &#34;loved it till someone stoled it. can&#39;t afford to replace it yet but i am going too.&#34;, &#39;alexa rocks&#39;, &#39;&#34;got this as a gift and love it. i never would have bought one for myself&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;&#34;my mom bought a few echo dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. i told her “no” for two days. when she made me take it&#39;, &#39;love it!! great product!!!&#39;, &#39;easy set up very user friendly&#39;, &#39;&#34;really disappointed alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  my fault for not checking this&#39;, &#34;i don&#39;t think the &amp;#34;2nd gen&amp;#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  but it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  but if you are going to do that why wouldn&#39;t you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn&#39;t unique to this unit but i don&#39;t understand why i can&#39;t override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &amp;#34;group&amp;#34;.  i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker.  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker.&#34;, &#39;everything&#39;, &#39;i like the interaction of asking questions. i don’t like that i can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.&#39;, &#39;supberb sound! definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.&#39;, &#39;i really love my amazon echo. i think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. it is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!&#39;, &#39;love it!  so do the grandkids!!&#39;, &#39;&#34;so far it has worked well. not always intuitive as to how to link different devices&#39;, &#39;works as advertised&#39;, &#39;i love it!&#39;, &#39;&#34;love my new addition to the house! speaker quality is great and over all we love our alexa. my only two ( not complaints&#39;, &#39;&#34;like everything about it. the music&#39;, &#39;as described and received on time.  do not like automatic enrolment into music.&#39;, &#39;a great device&#39;, &#39;i owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since english is her second language she was born in korea. but the sound from the echo is superb. so we’ll keep it..&#39;, &#39;love this!

(or just in one room)&#39;, &#34;it&#39;s extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn&#39;t answer everything i ask but it&#39;s still nice to use.&#34;, &#39;too difficult to set up.  it keeps timing out before you can enter the password&#39;, &#39;&#34;just getting use to using the echo. used it for shopping lists&#39;, &#39;very cool and lots of fun! used for a week and still learning its capabilities.&#39;, &#39;&#34;love it&#39;, &#39;love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps&#39;, &#39;i use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information&#39;, &#39;&#34;it\\&#39;s great for music&#39;, &#39;&#34;this was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. he loves it&#39;, &#39;&#34;very impressed with look&#39;, &#39;alexa is amazing! great speaker.&#39;, &#39;&#34;still getting used to alexa&#39;, &#39;&#34;works and sounds great! my house is barely 1100sf&#39;, &#39;&#34;i have had pure fun with my echo.  weather&#39;, &#39;use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home&#39;, &#39;&#34;love it&#39;, &#39;bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  she loves it!!  i especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!&#39;, &#39;we got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. will update. playing music is great though!&#39;, &#39;i am impressed with the sound quality.&#39;, &#39;&#34;very pleased with my purchase of echo smart speaker - love the fact that i can play music of different genre\\&#39;s whenever i want.had some trouble at first with the wi fi&#39;, &#39;&#34;my  wife &amp; i enjoy the ease of playing our music. the games are fun &amp; entertaining&#39;, &#39;&#34;this is my second echo and i love how it helps me in the kitchen. i can set timers&#39;, &#39;the sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions&#39;, &#39;&#34;this is my second echo&#39;, &#39;great sound&#39;, &#39;great&#39;, &#39;we really only use this as a speaker to stream music. we’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.&#39;, &#39;&#34;once set up very user friendly. set-up wasn\\&#39;t as user friendly as i\\&#39;d hoped.. the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. my wife and i are both retired and she wouldn\\&#39;t have been able to install alexa&#39;, &#39;very easy set up. really enjoying it&#39;, &#39;&#34;the echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it&#39;, &#39;more compact and a bit better than the original&#39;, &#39;i love it pretty cool.&#39;, &#39;i having it in my living room. music sounds really good in my living room . i can hear it upstairs.&#39;, &#39;this is a great product!  set up was easy.  sound is wonderful.&#39;, &#39;&#34;so far i like it.  i bought it just for some music though&#39;, &#39;love it&#39;, &#39;love it.&#39;, &#39;glad i bought this.&#39;, &#39;&#34;like&#39;, &#39;i like the volume up and down on the top so i can turn it down quickly.&#39;, &#39;beyond my capabilities to program. grandkids lve it&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love my new echo.  it gives me hours of music and help with other things.it was difficult for me to set it up&#39;, &#39;almost as good as my bose. love the whole house music.&#39;, &#39;alexa hardly came on..&#39;, &#39;&#34;easy setup using the app&#39;, &#39;&#34;i’m still learning how to use the echo&#39;, &#39;works awesome!&#39;, &#39;works great.&#39;, &#39;from such a small speaker it sounds great&#39;, &#39;great sound for the size and the prize!! and of course....alexa!&#39;, &#34;if you don&#39;t have an echo you definitely need one&#34;, &#39;great device.  seems to work better than the 1st generation!&#39;, &#39;item no longer works after just 5 months of use. will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.&#39;, &#39;i love the echo dot. so easy. so fun. i get to drop in on my grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. sounds like she is right next to me.&#39;, &#39;works great no different than the new ones&#39;, &#34;this one&#39;s going in the kitchen for timer/music duty.&#34;, &#39;&#34;love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. if it had better built in speaker\\&#39;s&#39;, &#39;works just fine.&#39;, &#39;works great! looks brand new! love my new echo dot. i will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house.&#39;, &#39;&#34;for a refurbished item.. it works like its new... which i love... easy set up&#39;, &#39;but not very loud&#39;, &#39;this is our 2nd one and we love it!&#39;, &#39;&#34;so i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot&#39;, &#34;this thing barely works. you have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you&#39;d think it could do out of the box. i&#39;m sending mine back asap. waste of money.&#34;, &#39;gift for my man. he doesn’t like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. would prefer it cordless. still works though for the purpose we bought it.&#39;, &#39;&#34;this is our 5th amazon echo device.  we have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied&#39;, &#39;&#34;this small echo dot is amazing the sounds that come out are great.it changes my nest thermostat&#39;, &#39;we talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can . there aren’t dislikes about this device.&#39;, &#39;i’m never disappointed with amazons technology.&#39;, &#39;worked as promised.&#39;, &#39;i returned 2 echo dots &amp; am only getting refund for 1. i returned 2 in one package. i want my refunds for both of them. they are in the same package. can you not see them both???!!!&#39;, &#39;not working&#39;, &#39;has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices.&#39;, &#39;i sure love alexa!  lol!  thank you!  great price and product!&#39;, &#39;it works&#39;, &#34;i&#39;m an echo fan but this one did not work&#34;, &#39; &#39;, &#34;bought for my bathroom to listen when i&#39;m in the shower.  love it.&#34;, &#34;doesn&#39;t always respond when spoken to with promp word. i thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom haven&#39;t been able to do that.&#34;, &#39;fast shipping and works well&#39;, &#39;i love it!!!!&#39;, &#39;love love love my new and free assistant!  :)&#39;, &#39;&#34;six words&#39;, &#34;it worked for a month or so then it stopped. i&#39;ve tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. i want a refund&#34;, &#39;poor quality. gave it away.&#39;, &#39;refurbished is the way to go. my echo works just like new.&#39;, &#39;love it&#39;, &#39;we have five of them. need i say more?&#39;, &#39;the speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. besides that naw&#39;, &#39;it works great and sounds good!&#39;, &#39;&#34;never could get it to work. a techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn\\&#39;t strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. so&#39;, &#39;almost like having star trek in your home!  fun to try and outsmart !&#39;, &#39;&#34;this was an add on for my echo system&#39;, &#39;&#34;great for my office. i use this daily in many ways&#39;, &#39;awesome. i love alexa.&#39;, &#39;&#34;i wasn\\&#39;t sure i really wanted one of these&#39;, &#39;&#34;initially&#39;, &#39;great product fast shipping&#39;, &#39;&#34;i bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often&#39;, &#39;perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished.&#39;, &#39;dont trust this....&#39;, &#39;perfect condition! i love my echo&#39;, &#39;love it. beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.&#39;, &#39;&#34;we just got this within the last couple of weeks&#39;, &#39;divertido&#39;, &#39;great product and works great&#39;, &#39;&#34;bought this for the guest room.  it\\&#39;s a radio&#39;, &#39;great buy. bought this to go with my echo and love it. the speaker isn’t the best for music but works great in a kitchen for timers or alarms.&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;works perfect. save a few bucks and buy the refurbished. looks brand new.&#39;, &#39;looks and works perfect. glad i got a good deal.&#39;, &#39;just as good as the new one i bought but $10.00 less.&#39;, &#39;i love it works very well&#39;, &#39;everything perfect&#39;, &#39;good price. prompt shipping. has been working flawlessly.&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love you&#39;, &#39;&#34;there\\&#39;s room for improvement on this. for the price&#39;, &#39;iove it i bought it for my son because he wanted it and it’s awesome&#39;, &#39;&#34;it\\&#39;s an echo&#39;, &#39;thanks&#39;, &#39;i wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  the speech recognition software is horrible.  my wife and i both are native americans whose language is english she is from the north i am from texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  we bought two they do the same thing.  additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. i had to buy wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  both had problems switched them around no difference.  so it they are now disconnected dust collectors.&#39;, &#39;this is my third dot. they all work perfectly and i use each one multiple times a day. absolutely love them.&#39;, &#39;item has never worked. out of box it is broken. spent several days trying to get it working and running same &amp;#34;fixes&amp;#34; from amazon. the only thing accomplished is i will never order another refurbished device.&#39;, &#39;i already have the echo plus.  bought this one for my bedroom.  love the functions.&#39;, &#39;simple set up.  music everywhere.&#39;, &#39;worked just like a brand new dot ---so i am very satisfied.&#39;, &#39;great product but returning for new alexa dot.  refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.&#39;, &#39;we have a few echos already. went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks. it works great. i love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom - nice.&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love the fact&#39;, &#34;refurbished but just as good as the new ones that i&#39;ve bought.&#34;, &#39;good as new&#39;, &#39;granddaughter loves it&#39;, &#39;&#34;the price is great.  was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room&#39;, &#34;we have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  can&#39;t wait to try more new stuff using alexa!&#34;, &#39;thanks&#39;, &#39;works great!&#39;, &#39;&#34;&amp;#34;never buy certified and refurbished echo dot &amp;#34; i bought a &amp;#34;certified and refurbished &amp;#34; echo dot. this unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. never buy a refurbished echo dot. the unit i received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. i also bought a new echo dot&#39;, &#39;started here with amazon productsand i regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life&#39;, &#39;have now used for several months without problem.&#39;, &#39;this is my first smart device and i will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.&#39;, &#39;love&#39;, &#39;love it just as good as a new one&#39;, &#39;have had an larger echo for some time and love it. bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.&#39;, &#39;love the product.  use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions.&#39;, &#39;a great buy&#39;, &#39;was leary about refurbished but work great.&#39;, &#39;&#34;very puny sound&#39;, &#39;great&#39;, &#39;&#34;exactly like new&#39;, &#39;works perfect no wear and tear on the device i love alexa working on making my home smart 😂&#39;, &#39;works good&#39;, &#34;the only thing i don&#39;t like is it shuts off by itself other than that it works great&#34;, &#39;&#34;excellent product&#39;, &#39;&#34;already owning a couple of echos&#39;, &#39;love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. it is awesome have used it for everything my lights since i work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. and planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... i would recommend this to everyone!!!!&#39;, &#39;love alexa hope have her in every room soon.&#39;, &#39;the simplicity of use and setting up.&#39;, &#39;this is great! got one for my gazebo and one upstairs.&#39;, &#39;&#34;works great&#39;, &#39;does everything i have asked it.&#39;, &#39;works great ..good sound&#39;, &#39;&#34;i use this echo to listen to music as well as a sort-of research tool. it can answer a variety of questions. i would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder&#39;, &#39;love it!  great fun!&#39;, &#39;love it!&#39;, &#39;outstanding i use all the time....works just like they say&#39;, &#39;&#34;saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less&#39;, &#39;&#34;works perfectly&#39;, &#39;never would know it was refurbished.&#39;, &#39;so far so good&#39;, &#39;looks and performs as new.  no complaints!&#39;, &#39;goes great with our echo&#39;, &#39;works great just like the new one that i already had.&#39;, &#39;&#34;this item did not work. certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. instead this item crashed as soon as i turned it on and plugged it in. when trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot&#39;, &#39;&#34;very fast service&#39;, &#39;love it even though i’m still trying to figure out all the other things i can do with this item it works great with my phone.&#39;, &#39;none&#39;, &#39;&#34;i have 2 echos&#39;, &#39;a great product...once we learned how to work it...this thing is awesome!!!&#39;, &#39;it works&#39;, &#39;does not work all the time&#39;, &#39;&#34;love it. though&#39;, &#39;of course!&#39;, &#39;you could not tell this was refurbished. works excellent. i would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.&#39;, &#39;i got this for my mom . she loves it !&#39;, &#39;i love my echo dot! looks brand new and works perfect! very satisfied.&#39;, &#39;same as new&#39;, &#39;&#34;a small problem out of the box&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love my alexa dot. i play games with my son&#39;, &#34;i like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart tv if i ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if i ask you to change the channel it does or doesn&#39;t sometimes i have to reset it i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because it&#39;s refurbished but it&#39;s okay it&#39;s just not what i expected&#34;, &#39;&#34;so far the certified refurbished echo dot works well. it was a little confusing to have a green ring on the echo dot and not 100% know why it was there. asked alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. but that was not the case. took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that i had a delivery from amazon. i believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification&#39;, &#39;it arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what i expected ! alexa and i have become buddies she is a great assistant&#39;, &#39;&#34;works as advertised. speak clearly&#39;, &#34;love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  the return process still isn&#39;t done and has already taken weeks.&#34;, &#34;i&#39;ve already returned it.&#34;, &#39;&#34;the refurbished echo for has been wonderful. i purchased this for my mother. she loves the ability to contact me without a phone&#39;, &#39;&#34;works good. however&#39;, &#39;works amazingly. i bought it for my daughter and she loves it.&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love alexa! it\\&#39;s great helping me&#39;, &#39;got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe. we showering.&#39;, &#39;i have 3-dots and 2-original and this new one works perfectly.  will buy all my future dots reconditioned.&#39;, &#39;was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all&#39;, &#39;&#34;now i\\&#39;m weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  i have 3-4&#39;, &#34;there&#39;s really no dislike for alexa( dot) i thought cortna was cool but alexa is an awesome application to the family. unbelievable device which seems alive. a must get.&#34;, &#39;&#34;i am happy with the refurbished echo dot. i’ve had it for about two weeks&#39;, &#39;thumbs up!&#39;, &#39;workreat&#39;, &#39;&#34;there was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep i spoke with could fix. the replacement was registered to someone else. when the price of the dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones)&#39;, &#39;works as expected!&#39;, &#39;no problems&#39;, &#39;have these in almost every room. i really have enjoyed them. works perfectly.&#39;, &#39;purchased for grandson.&#39;, &#39;like new&#39;, &#39;happy with this as i was with the other 2 i ordered!!&#39;, &#39;&#34;love the dots&#39;, &#39;&#34;started taking on her own! haven’t used it since i unplugged it that day. no one was talking&#39;, &#39;it works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend&#39;, &#39;great! just like new!&#39;, &#39;&#34;loved the price for an essentially brand new dot!! opening it&#39;, &#39;pleased with the order just what i wanted!!&#39;, &#39;&#34;i think i now have 5 of these throughout the house. so convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever&#39;, &#39;love it -- the best.  my experience with refurbished devices is excellent.&#39;, &#39;love the echo dot&#39;, &#39;&#34;this refurbished item was fine&#39;, &#39;&#34;two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  no connection&#39;, &#39;it worked like a brandnew unit! great addition to my collection.&#39;, &#39;&#34;great price&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;very.god&#39;, &#39;not good at all!&#39;, &#34;these are great. i bought one and then bought another right away. grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you&#39;re set with smart home capabilities for under $150. highly recommended.&#34;, &#39;just like new&#39;, &#39;&#34;worked as it should&#39;, &#39;very useful&#39;, &#39;&#34;this is the worst amazon purchase i have made. i am big amazon fan...love the brand...unlimited digital music...prime videos...even buy my online games&#39;, &#39;&#34;works very well&#39;, &#39;i bought two refurbished ones for work and home. they both work perfectly and appear brand new&#39;, &#34;amazon doesn&#39;t disappoint.&#34;, &#39;works great as a bt receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment.&#39;, &#39;&#34;working great this far.  can\\&#39;t tell it\\&#39;s not new.  will edit for longevity in a year&#39;, &#39;amazing&#39;, &#39;i love everything&#39;, &#39;&#34;this used “dot” works fine&#39;, &#39;works like a new one.  can tell the difference from the new one i bough and the refurbished one.&#39;, &#39;well i’m a big fan of echoes these ones went i’m my bathrooms.  works just great as expected 👍🏾&#39;, &#39;purchased for my 83 year old mother-she loves talking to alexa! very responsive-can detect its “name” from all over the room.&#39;, &#39;this is just like new -- same performance as our brand new one; no problems.&#39;, &#39;the echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.&#39;, &#39;love it.  great product&#39;, &#39;it works good.  very satisfied&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love alexa&#39;, &#39;&#34;took me awhile to get it connected. i\\&#39;m not electronically savy but now that it is&#39;, &#39;cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure if i will be returning it will try one more time.&#39;, &#39;absolutely love it!&#39;, &#39;product stopped working after return time ran out&#39;, &#39;second dot work great for refurbishedthought it was new&#39;, &#39;love these guys they work so great&#39;, &#39;&#34;i love this as a second &amp;#34;alexa&amp;#34; in our bedroom.  great for checking weather&#39;, &#39;i purchased this refurbished.  works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. very easy.  now i have echo dot that i can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.&#39;, &#39;not substitute for the original.  the echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  to listen it has to be at the highest level 10.&#39;, &#39;love the echo dot. helps husband get netflix and other apps on our amazon fire tv.  no problems with it being refurbished. planning on getting another one for the amazon fire stick in bedroom.&#39;, &#39;&#34;stopped working after 7 months. the warranty was only good for 3 months. i would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. i mean what is this product supposed to be&#39;, &#39;&#34;just like new. no problems whatsoever&#39;, &#39;i like my uncle. but sometime it goes a little haywire&#39;, &#39;bought this for my son and it didn’t work. he had to return it.&#39;, &#39;bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.&#39;, &#39;&#34;i received my echo dot today in good condition&#39;, &#39;i bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. but i have no need for it. i only used it once. the volume was not loud enough for me when i played music while i was on my treadmill. so i rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.&#39;, &#39;worked like new.  will do it again.&#39;, &#39;the second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.&#39;, &#39;&#34;very bad this device&#39;, &#39;good as new!! just like brand new! save yourself some money. get one!&#39;, &#39;adding more rooms for convenience&#39;, &#39;&#34;nice. it works good.some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times&#39;, &#39;&#34;i took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the alexa app on my iphone was flawless. listening to my favorite tunes through a bose bluetooth setup and couldn\\&#39;t be happier. walk through the door and just ask alexa to: &amp;#34;play 80\\&#39;s music&amp;#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! no more opening the ipad&#39;, &#34;alexa&#39;s sister (my second dot)&#34;, &#39;&#34;love my alexa echo dot - i have two of them now - one new&#39;, &#39;&#34;bought a refurb&#39;, &#34;love it. it&#39;s like having a second wife.&#34;, &#34;so far not impressed at all. does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time i&#39;m not sure what the excitement is all about. alexas voice sounds like it&#39;s under water how am i supposed to understand!!!!i&#39;m going to return and try a google home!!!&#34;, &#39;works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.&#39;, &#39;&#34;works great&#39;, &#39;&#34;great product&#39;, &#39;worked just as good as the two new echo dots i preciously purchases.&#39;, &#39;i bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.she loves the guard dog feature.she says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house&#39;, &#39;i bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone. not working for me. read instructions but not working for me.&#39;, &#39;it works&#39;, &#39;&#34;bought two of them and both work great. i\\&#39;m not much on electronics running my home&#39;, &#39;2nd one... more to come&#39;, &#39;blue light blinks all the time&#39;, &#34;fun and useful. we&#39;re still learning new tricks and useful functionalities. this is the future of human to computer interface and household automation. just like star trek! who knew it would be here so soon?&#34;, &#39;&#34;works great to control the tv lights and various other devices. lately i\\&#39;ve been using it when i wake up and don\\&#39;t know what time it is but don\\&#39;t want to open my eyes. just shout out &amp;#34;alexa&#39;, &#39;works great!&#39;, &#34;wasn&#39;t sure if i&#39;d like this product but after having it for a little while i want one in every room! my daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. we&#39;ve barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and i&#39;m looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!&#34;, &#39;a++++&#39;, &#39;great product. works well&#39;, &#39;absolutly love it !&#39;, &#39;bought my first echo dot and loved it so i got this for work. absolutely love it!&#39;, &#39;works as promised&#39;, &#39;works great with my existing smart home setup.&#39;, &#39;perfect. could not tell the difference from a new one.&#39;, &#39;i cant figure out how to use it.&#39;, &#39;good sometimes can’t hear well&#39;, &#39;&#34;i was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product&#39;, &#39;not bad bad speaker for sound&#39;, &#39;&#34;this is a great device. we mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list&#39;, &#39;we all love her!&#39;, &#39;i purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!&#39;, &#39;it doesn’t always  work&#39;, &#39;good as new! perfectly packaged and i have had zero issues with the dot.&#39;, &#39;love it! bought for my granddaughter who is 3 for her to play music and ask questions. she is entertained for hours! good buy in my honest opinion!&#39;, &#39;no issues...works and looks great!!!&#39;, &#39;this is a fun toy.  my daughter have me it.  it reads to me!&#39;, &#39;&#34;refurbish echo dot received as new condition&#39;, &#39;&#34;i received an echo as a gift&#39;, &#39;worked as advertised. thanks&#39;, &#39;all the new amazon products i have are great everything i bought refurbished is complete garbage. i will never purchase amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction&#39;, &#39;works good.  microphone is not as good as the better echo products&#39;, &#39;took a little work to set up but i finally got it.  sound quality not the best but for what i got it for it works great.  i check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  i do play the radio on it when i want some music but will probably upgrade to the echo plus for better sound.&#39;, &#34;love alexa these are the best thing i have ever bought don&#39;t know how i ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to&#34;, &#39;i loved it it works great&#39;, &#39;extremely low in volume&#39;, &#39;&#34;i had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. i ended up using my computer. it is interesting that the answers come from wikipedia. however&#39;, &#39;&#34;brought to replace one that i moved and doesn\\&#39;t have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. it would seldom be able to find the wi-fi and couldn\\&#39;t connect. got tired of hearing the message (&amp;#34;trouble connecting...check the alexa app...&amp;#34;) and just unplugged it. i went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times&#39;, &#39;&#34;if you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the echo/dot units simultaneously&#39;, &#39;&#34;purchased as a gift&#39;, &#39;love it&#39;, &#39;&#34;overall good device. it was bought for a workout room&#39;, &#34;works great and simple to set up. alexa is way more accurate than i imagined so im using it more than i thought. wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.no she&#39;s not listening when you don&#39;t say the wake word so if you&#39;re worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. the speaker is great too so don&#39;t hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.&#34;, &#39;the voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)&#39;, &#39;worked perfect&#39;, &#39;&#34;had a little trouble at the beginning until i replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  like when it was 9\n*** WARNING: skipped 211904 bytes of output
